# LIST
This project is a personal project of mine where I have created a list ADT through a Linked List implementation. It contains the common operations performed by a simple list ADT. Each file contains an operation which is explained through comments. Also lastly since all the nodes are dynamically allocated I have also made sure to keep a track of all the nodes I remove from the list and free them properly. To confirm this I have used valgrind to make sure there are no memory leaks, and initialization errors.
